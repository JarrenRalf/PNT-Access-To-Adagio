How does this spreadsheet benefit Pacific Net & Twine?
- Pacific Net and Twine uses a primary database to store costs, and has our desired pricing structures built in. This database only communicates with our accounting software database when manually told to. Changes in our primary database do not occcur in our secondary database for 24 hours. Using this spreadsheet, we can take information from our primary database and push it to our secondary one.
