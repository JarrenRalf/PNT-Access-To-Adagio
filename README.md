How does this spreadsheet benefit Pacific Net & Twine?
- Our primary Access database is manually pushed to our Adagio database outside of business hours. When new products are created in Access, they are not available in our point of sale, accounting, purchasing, or order entry programs until the following business day. This spreadshee allows the user to export from our Access database and them import into our Adagio Inventory program so that new items are available instantly.
